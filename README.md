Our implementation successfully provides the top 10 documents based on the DPH score relevance ranking of a set of user-defined queries. It also takes into consideration duplicate results and returns only the top results with overly similar documents filtered out using a similarity score.

**Note** : As discussed, we were facing a lot of issues during version controlling of the java
code in git as the .gitignore file was ignoring some important .project and .classpath files
which was causing improper structures and resulting in various errors.
As a workaround, in order to get things moving, we developed a large part of the code locally in our systems while using a raw local version control of the code between team members. We committed the final version of the code based on the tasks done be each team member in the end altogether but the tasks have been done prior to the final version commits.
